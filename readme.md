# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is a full-stack application that allows users to track and view all of their workouts. The user may add to or view their latest workout, or start a new workout where they can enter information about the exercises they completed. Through the dashboard, the user can view graphical representations of their workouts on a day to day basis. 

Building this application thought the pros and cons of using a noNQL database. Although they have a tone of flexibility, noSQL databases are more difficult to debug due to the fact that they rarely throw errors if something is the request to the db is off. I spent a decent amount of time debugging my put request to add an exercise to the workout exercises array because I had a minor typo. Typically that would be something really easy to pinpoint, but because the db wasn't throwing any errors, I had to console debug.
