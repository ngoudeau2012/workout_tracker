# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is a full-stack application that allows users to track and view all of their workouts. The user may add to or view their latest workout, or start a new workout where they can enter information about the exercises they completed. Through the dashboard, the user can view graphical representations of their workouts on a day to day basis. 

Building this application thought me how to build and integrate a back-end server using express. I learned about connecting the front-end and the backend through ajax calls paired with proper backend api routes. I learned how to properly work with promises and asynchronous calls. Lastly, it also taught me the importance of project organization and prework. Having everything laid out before I started building routes allowed me to keep my work flow clear and concise. 

Some of the problems that I encountered and overcame while building this application involved implementing the full C.R.U.D circle for a static JSON db. Initially, I was able to get the proper data/actions that I wanted from the front end, but struggled to read and write to the static JSON file.
